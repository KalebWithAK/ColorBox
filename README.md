#ColorBox

Objective: create a grid of boxes that alternate between black and white when clicked

Limitations: when createGrid is given an even number for the rows parameter, the columns alternate between black and white instead of giving a checkerboard pattern

Possible improvements: 
- take user input to specify grid size (either through text box or alert message) 
- fix the even columns bug (make the grid look more like a chessboard)
